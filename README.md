The website's name is Foodvillage. Basically, this website is a food ordering website. When you visit this website, you will see a navbar with many routes. There, you can visit our home page, menu, our shop, contact page, and cart/dashboard. On the home page, you will see our shop details, like a banner with multiple slides, customer reviews, and recommended foods. On the menu page, you can see food details with prices. On our shop page, you can see five food categories, and under each category, you will see multiple food items. On the contact page, you will find our shop contact information, location information, and a form to message us. Then comes the cart or dashboard option. If you are an admin, then you will see the dashboard option, and if you are a normal user, then you will see the cart option icon. As a user, you can add food to the cart only after logging in. Then, if you add food, in the cart icon, the number of food items you have selected will be shown. The cart icon is clickable.
